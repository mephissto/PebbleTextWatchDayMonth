Pebble Text Watch With Date
===========================

This Pebble watch was inspired by all the Pebble Text we can out there.

This one is based of (https://github.com/paulpullen/PebbleTextWatch).

I changed the date format, now on one line and in the format "dd mmm" where dd is the day of the month in number and mmm is the month in 3 letters.

A video with the text changing animation can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVTCtfZ-GsU

Updated with a stylistic date in the bottom-right corner.
